# Python Metaprogramming Demo

This repository demonstrates practical Python metaprogramming techniques through a simple document processing system with a plugin architecture.

## Overview

The project showcases how to dynamically extend class functionality at runtime using a plugin system. The project illustrates several important Python metaprogramming concepts:

- Runtime class modification
- Dynamic method injection
- Plugin architecture implementation
- Module importing and introspection
